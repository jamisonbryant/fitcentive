# Fitcentive

Fitcentive is an Android app that incentivizes fitness. Ever been tempted to run a marathon or eat
healthy for an entire week, only to change your mind because there was no real *incentive* to?

Now there is! Fitcentive awards you Fitness Points (FP for short) that you can spend on cool stuff
like discounts on gym memberships, free exercise or wellness classes, and even coupons for healthy
food at your favorite local restauraunt!

This application is being developed for the 2015 DC Code-A-Thon, sponsored by Kaiser Permanante.
